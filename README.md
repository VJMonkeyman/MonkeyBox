MonkeyBox is a Windows application in which you can  control live visuals with  an XBOX 360 controller. You control an 80s style car through a synthwave inspired landscape and can add psychedelic FX by the press of a button.
This is the first test version, so do not expect it to run and function perfectly.

How to start:

Unzip the release file and open the folder. Go to the MonkeyBox AlphaRelease v0.1 folder and open it. Inside you will find an .exe file named the same. Start up and enjoy!


how to view the source code:

Open up the .vl in VVVV to view the project. You need to download the VL.XBox360 NuGet for the controller to work. Add the file car.obj to the folder of the .vl file.
The Xbox controller has to be connected before starting the programm otherwise it will not work.


controls:


"A" button: for tap tempo/setting the BPM
"B" button: lets lighting/bloom flash
"X" button: the "videowall" effect, replicating the video in a video matrix. Each press of the button zooms further out. The 4th step will result in a 5x5 matrix, another button press resets the effect.
"Y" button: starts/stops BPM timed FX.
"RB" & "LB": switch BPM timed FX (at the moment there are 4 different ones)
"RT": Edge detection
"LT": Strobe (the more you press the button the higher the frequency)
"D-Pad Right": switch color
"D-Pad Up/Down": switch between cameras
"D-Pad Left": switch between animated and static FOV
"Left Stick": control the car
"Right Stick": control the camera


There is NO quit button at the moment, you need to end the programm with alt+F4.

The programm supports "Spout" where it shares the video output with other programms like Resolume or OBS for example so you can use it with projection mapping software.
