MonkeyBox is a Windows application in which you can  control live visuals with  an XBOX 360 controller. You control an 80s style car through a synthwave inspired landscape and can add psychedelic FX by the press of a button.
This is the first test version, so do not expect it to run and function perfectly.

how to start:
Open up the .vl in VVVV to view the project. You can publish it to get a folder with an .exe file. The 3D model of the car is in the car.obj file and need to be in the correct folder in order to function.
the Xbox controller has to be connected before starting the programm otherwise it will not work.

controls:
"A" button: for tap tempo/setting the BPM
"B" button: lets lighting/bloom flash
"X" button: the "videowall" effect, replicating the video in a video matrix. Each press of the button zooms further out. The 4th step will result in a 5x5 matrix, another button press resets the effect.
"Y" button: starts/stops BPM timed FX.
"RB" & "LB": switch BPM timed FX (at the moment there are 4 different ones)
"RT": Edge detection
"LT": Strobe (the more you press the button the higher the frequency)
"D-Pad Right": switch color
"D-Pad Up/Down": switch between cameras
"D-Pad Left": switch between animated and static FOV
"Left Stick": control the car
"Right Stick": control the camera

There is NO quit button at the moment, you need to end the programm with alt+F4.

The programm supports "Spout" where it shares the video output with other programms like Resolume or OBS for example so you can use it with projection mapping software.

If there is bugs/ideas/comments please let me know, i am glad about any feedback i get! @VJ.Monkeyman on instagram or https://www.reddit.com/user/Benjie936/ on reddit
